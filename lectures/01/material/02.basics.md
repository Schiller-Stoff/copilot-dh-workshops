# Base commands / use cases for Github copilot 


## 01. IDE - Common features

1. Auto-complete
2. Recommendations ("choose from a list of possible solutions")
3. Self controlled IDE commands / prompts
4. Integrated chat


## 02. IDE Support

Handled via third party plugins (might change in the near future)

- Jetbrains IDEs
    Intellij
    Pycharm 
    etc.
- Microsoft IDEs
    Visual Studio 
    Visual Studio code
    etc.


## 03. VSCode: Plugin

- Github copilot plugin 
- installation via VSCode marketplace
- needs to be linked to your github account (+ needs an actice subscription)

- it's not necessary to work on a github clone


## 04. VSCode: Github Copilot Features

- VSCode Basic: "STRG + SHIFT + P" --> opens VSCode comand search bar

- github copilot commands via search bar! 

- icon at the bottom bar
- icon for chat at the left side
- integrated features without explicit GUI elements.


### Auto-complete

Integrated like any other auto-completion feature of IDEs

Basic usage:
- Plugin displays code recommendation --> Prompt for suggestion: "ALT + ^"
- user accepts via "TAB"
- or: via "ALT + ÃŸ" or "alt + `" --> switch between different recommendations. 

Test it out:
```py
# e.g. inside demo.py

# copilot should show some suggestions
def calc_mean(arg1, arg2):
    """
    
    """


```

### Code Recommendations

- user is more actively involved with reviewing AI generated code.
- controlled via the recommendations panel - command "Open Completions Panel" (open via icon )
- user chooses between different suggestions from the panel.

```js
// e.g. in demo.js

/**
 * Change generation via providing different contexts, like jsdoc decsription
 * or different arguments.
 * 
 * */
const calc_mean = (numbers) => {
    // "Open Completions Panel" and select from different suggestion

}

```

### Self controlled IDE commands / prompts

- use the chat icon from the left bar
- start prompt with "/"
- "/generate", "/explain", "/fix", ""

- operates on currently open file, marked text etc. 


```js
const displayInTerminal = (toBeDisplayed) => {
    console.log(toBeDisplayed);
}

// mark the function here in markdown file
// open up copilot integration via chat-icon 
// type in "/explain"

```

```js
const divideThroughGivenNumber = (divisor) => {
    return 10 / divisor;
}

// mark function
// open up copilot integration via chat-icon 
// type in "/fix"


```

```py

def remove_big_folders():
    """
    Loops through the current working directory and deletes all directories 
    that are bigger than 10GB. 
    """
    # TODO implement!

# mark function
# open up copilot integration via chat-icon 
# type in "/generate"

# or directly inject code via "GitHub Copilot: Generate this"

```


### Integrated chat

- ask arbitrary question directly in the chat
- e.g. How can I delete a file via bash?
