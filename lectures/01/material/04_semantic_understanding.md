# Semantic understanding

## Excercise 

1. Create a Metadata.py file with the following class skeleton.

```py

class Metadata:
    """
    This class contains my metadata
    """
    pass

```

2. Let github copilot suggest some completions / use the autocomplete



3. Create a TEIHeader.py with the following class skeleton: 

```py

class TEIHeader:
    """
    
    """
    pass

```

4. Trigger suggestions / completions from Github copilot


## Background

- copilot takes context into consideration!
- so: naming, comments, descriptions etc. matter a lot! --> modelling 
- if the real world problem is represented by adequate modelling --> copilot can help with the real world problem instead of solving "pure coding problems".
