Test it out:
```py
# e.g. inside demo.py

# copilot should show some suggestions
def calc_mean(arg1, arg2):
    """
    
    """


```

### Code Recommendations

- user is more actively involved with reviewing AI generated code.
- controlled via the recommendations panel - command "Open Completions Panel" (open via icon )
- user chooses between different suggestions from the panel.

```js
// e.g. in demo.js

/**
 * Change generation via providing different contexts, like jsdoc decsription
 * or different arguments.
 * 
 * */
const calc_mean = (numbers) => {
    // "Open Completions Panel" and select from different suggestion

}

```
